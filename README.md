# keithley-2450-EIS

This project aims to perform a Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on a Li-Ion rechargeable battery using the Keithley 2450 Source Measure Unit (SMU) Instrument. Even the EIS is not among the applications listed in the official documentation,  the features of the instrument allow to perform the impedance measurement up to 100Hz.

The measurement of battery impedance is crucial for online monitoring of State of Charge and State of Health [1](docs/references.md#1). Lab measurements with Keithley 2450 can be used as bechmark to validate data from custom build impedence monitoring system such as [2](docs/references.md#2)
