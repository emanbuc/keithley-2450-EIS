# Remote Operations

In remote operation mode a computer (controller) is programmed to send sequences of commands to an instrument.  The controller orchestrates the actions of the instrumentation.

The controller is typically programmed to request measurement results from the instrumentation and make test sequence decisions based on those measurements.
